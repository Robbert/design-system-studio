# Demo templates with NL Design System components

Using existing React components from [https://nldesignsystem.nl/componenten/](https://nldesignsystem.nl/componenten/) and with custom components whenever nescessary.

## Purpose of these templates

To show how the NL Design System components can work together in a layout and how theming makes these templates look different for different brands.

## Development

This project uses NextJS as a framework for rendering the templates and StencilJS for creating web components.

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

### NodeJS and pnpm

We use NodeJS for installing and managing our javascript packages. Check in your terminal with `node -v` if you have NodeJS installed. Otherwise install node [https://nodejs.org/en](https://nodejs.org/en) before you start.

NodeJS comes with `npm`. We will not use `npm` to install our packages, but `pnpm` instead. This is so we can ensure super stable package resolution. To get started make sure you have `pnpm` installed by checking with `pnpm -v`. If you do not see a version use `npm install -g pnpm` to install `pnpm` globally on your machine.

### ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
